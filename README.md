# T-Intersection

I created a T-Intersection with an Arduino Uno and multiple sensors and servos.

This included:
* Arduino Uno as the brains of the project
* A working parking lot gate with an IR sensors to detect the car
* A working street light that would turn on when it is night time. This was made using a light sensor
* A working street light and cross walk with a pedestrian button and cross walk

I overall build of the project was made with a lot of 3D printed components that I 3D modelled on my own using 3Ds Max
